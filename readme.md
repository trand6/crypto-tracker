## Cryptocurrency Scraper ðŸ’°

## About ðŸª™
This tracker uses Python to fetch and display cryptocurrency information to a terminal.
Other features to be added include currency conversion and more.

I thought this project gave me a good opportunity to practice using the pandas library to scrape cryptocurrency data from exchanges.
